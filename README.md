# Introduction

In our courses, desktop virtualization is done using VMWare Workstation or Microsoft Hyper-V. In these notes, I am looking at VMWare Workstation technology and we refer to these technologies as Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs).

You need to develop a good skill level and familiarity and understand what you can and cannot do with Virtual Machines (VMs). You also need to understand snapshots, cloning and the VM network environment. The examples I give or details in my notes may be version specific and relate to a particular distro of Linux, it is your responsibility to ensure everything works. I donâ€™t give step by step instructions for everything you have to do.

Figuring out how to do things is part of the exercise!

Before you start, find the documentation for the version of VMWare Workstation you are using, from the VMWare web site.

You can find a video where I walk through building a Linux VM [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/e55bbad931f17c5b69199fb57fc01b70).

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 10 VM can be found [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/54bdd73ae51987aa48900895650081ae).

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 2016 VM can be found [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/23b07ab94e040ce811edea32712cab8d).
