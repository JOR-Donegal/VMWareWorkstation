# Getting Started

Before you start, find the documentation for the version of VMWare Workstation you are using, from the VMWare web site.

You can find a video where I walk through building a Linux VM [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/e55bbad931f17c5b69199fb57fc01b70).

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 10 VM can be found [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/54bdd73ae51987aa48900895650081ae).

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 2016 VM can be found [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/23b07ab94e040ce811edea32712cab8d).

A screenshot of my VMWare Workstation instance</p></figcaption></figure>

I keep my VMs tidy on a per topic basis. For example, all my VMs for the module “NETW CP901 Enterprise and Data Center Networking” sit in a folder with the course code.

Create an appropriate folder for this module, keep VMs for this module in it.

## Exercise

Based on the video above

1. Create a VM called **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop**.
2. Create a VM called **Ubuntu 24.04 Server**.
3. Update the descriptions in VMWare Workstation

Everything we do is based on the methodology **Research** then **Do**, then **Test and Document**.

What is an appropriate test to verify that you have completed the above work?
