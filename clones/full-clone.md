# Full Clone

Create a full clone of the existing server VM

* Check how long it takes
* Examine the disk files afterwards, for both the parent and child VM.
* Call the new VM <mark style="color:red;">OS</mark>-<mark style="color:blue;">L00xxxxxx</mark> where;
  * <mark style="color:red;">OS</mark> is the OS type, for example UB2404
  * <mark style="color:blue;">L00xxxxxx</mark> is your L number

Restart and test the parent and child VMs.

* Can they all use the network?
* Check the MAC address of the network card on both.
* Are they the same?
