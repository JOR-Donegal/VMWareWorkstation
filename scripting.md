# Scripting

Locate “Using VMware Workstation Pro” from the VMWare site. Find "Using the vmrun Command to Control Virtual Machines"

Run the command **vmrun** and document;

1. Flags
2. Power Commands
3. Snapshot Commands
4. Guest OS commands

Try some commands. Create a clone of a VM, start it, stop it and then delete it.

There is a newer tool available since Workstation 17.6, **vmcli**. Do some reading and see if that works. Give it a try and let me know how you got on.
