# Networking

Download “Using VMware Workstation X Pro” from the VMWare site. Review the section “Configuring Network Connections”. You need to read and understand the full chapter!

Go to the tab **Edit->Virtual Network Editor**.

Click on **Change Settings**.

There are three networks configured.

Identify the networks, ensure you can sketch all the networks and that you understand how they work.

Document the full configuration of all the networks in a spreadsheet and diagram (e.g. what DHCP exists, how a VM gets DNS, host address, what the gateways are).
